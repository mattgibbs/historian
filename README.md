Historian
=========

A web-based interface for plotting data from the EPICS Archiver Appliance.

Uses D3.js (included) for plots.

Right now, you can only run Historian locally, due to the XMLHTTPRequest single-origin policy.  Save the directory somewhere on your computer, open index.html in a browser, and everything should work.
